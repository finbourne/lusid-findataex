## Warning On Vendor Package

Classes in the Vendor.Auto package have been autogenerated and manually tweaked with reference to BBG DL docs.

Should not require changing unless BBG DLWS is being overhauled or a new feature built that is required by
FinDataEx (unlikely).
 
DON'T change unless absolutely necessary.
